This project simulates the computer working principle dividing in instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, memory and write back in cpp. Single stage achieves them in one cycle, and five stage is based on five-stage pipelining with full forwarding and hazard detection. The project totally supports 15 RISC-V instructions of 5 RISC-V R,I,J,B,S instruction types.
